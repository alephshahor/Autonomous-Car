# Autonomous Car

This program simulates the behaviour of an autonomous car  picking-up passengers and its path finding algorythms on a grid with obstacles.

We simulate an M x N grid with free cells and occupied cells (obstacles). Our car can move freely between free cells on a NSEW movement (no diagonal movements). We also can put freely obstacles in the grid (and remove them) with the mouse. 


We are using c++ for general programing, and for the graphics we are using the open source [SFML libraries](https://www.sfml-dev.org)
